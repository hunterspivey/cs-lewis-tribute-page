                <p>The ability to wrestle with intricate, multi-faceted ideas and come out on the other side with something helpful is rare. To do this in a way that the layperson can grasp is practically unheard of. This is why C.S. Lewis changed the direction of the church, and consequently the West, forever.</p>
                <p>Lewis may be best-known for his fiction, specifically The Chronicles of Narnia. He was a voracious reader (legend has it that he could recite the entirety of any paragraph in any book in his library upon hearing the first line), and was passionate about myth, fantasy, philosophy, science, and religion. His fiction has a philosophical and religious bent, and his essays reflect creativity and narrative clarity that non-fiction authors struggle to achieve.</p>
                <p>While his fiction grasped the attention of millions, his thoughtful and persuasive non-fiction works are what helped changed how thinking Christians saw their world. He had a strong message of unity within the church, and was an empathetic peacemaker outside the church. "Mere Christianity", his most well-known book outside the Narnia series, embodies this.</p>
                <p>In the acidic climate of 21st century western culture, Lewis's words are refreshing and powerful. They softened and deepend the conversations of the 20th century church, and they can do the same for us, if we listen.</p>
